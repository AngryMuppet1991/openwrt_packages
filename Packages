Description:  Alarm Pinger (apinger) is a little tool which monitors various IP devices by
 simple ICMP echo requests. There are various other tools, that can do this,
 but most of them are shell or perl scripts, spawning many processes, thus much
 CPU-expensive, especially when one wants continuous monitoring and fast
 response on target failure.  Alarm Pinger is a single program written in C, so
 it doesn't need much CPU power even when monitoring many targets with frequent
 probes.  Alarm Pinger supports both IPv4 and IPv6. The code have been tested
 on Linux and FreeBSD.

Description:  external protocol is a general protocol for assisting
 setup of many virtual devices that lack proper
 protocol support in openwrt. Such as netavark, cni and
 netbird for example. External protocol is supposed
 to be managed with external software, not directly.
 
 external protocol works automaticly on the background
 and sets up netifd details when interface comes up or
 goes down. This allows one to easily add interface to
 a firewall zone.
 
 as a example use case, podman, with network where it's
 internal firewall and portmapper are disabled, control
 of firewalling, whether it was exposing ports or
 limiting/accepting access between networks, such as
 lan can be made through openwrt's own firewalling
 configuration if you used external protocol.
 
 podman example configuration could be as following:
 - lan network: 10.0.0.0/16 (255.255.0.0)
 - container network: 10.129.0.1/24 (255.255.255.0)
 
 Add a network configuration for your container network
 using external protocol. Then create firewall zone for it.
 
 You could create a new container/pod with static ip
 address 10.129.0.2 (as 10.129.0.1 as container network's
 gateway).
 
 Easily define permissions so that local networks can
 connect to container network, but not the other way around.
 Also you want to allow forwarding from/to wan.
 
 Now, as container cannot access local dns, make a rule for
 your firewall to accept connections from container network
 to port 53 (dns).
 
 Now all you have to do, is make redirects to your firewall
 and point them to 10.129.0.2 and connections from wan are
 redirectered to containers/pods.
 
 external protocol also works for other applications as
 well that are using veth/tun/etc devices and don't have
 a hand-tailored protocol available, such as vpn service
 netbird.
 
 Protocol has 3 settings: device, searchdomain and delay.
 Sometimes polling interfaces takes some time, and in
 that case you might want to add few seconds to delay.
 Otherwise, it can be excluded from configuration.
 Option for searchdomain is also completely optional.
 
 package was previously known as cni protocol but as
 it can be used on so many other things, naming became
 mis-leading and it was renamed to external protocol.

Description:  This project (pronounced gen'-see-oh) is used to abstract stream I/O
 like serial port, TCP, telnet, UDP, SSL, IPMI SOL etc and offers a
 framework for giving a consistent view of various stream (and packet)
 I/O types. You create a gensio object (or a gensio), and you can use
 that gensio without having to know too much about what is going on
 underneath. You can stack gensio on top of another one to add protocol
 funcionality. For instance, you can create a TCP gensio, stack SSL on
 top of that, and stack Telnet on top of that. It supports a number of
 network I/O and serial ports.  Gensio can be used for sending and
 receiving ports, and it also supports establishing encrypted and
 authenticated connections.

Description:  The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive.
 
 Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of
 multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables
 flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to
 machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power
 of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language
 that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
 
 This package provides the documentation for the Go programming language.

Description:  libdaemon is a lightweight C library that eases the writing of UNIX daemons.
 It consists of the following parts:
 - A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization procedure of a process
 - A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log output to Syslog or STDERR
 - An API for writing PID files
 - An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage with select() or poll()
 - An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 
 APIs like these are used in most daemon software available. It is not that
 simple to get it done right and code duplication is not a goal.

Description:  The libffi library provides a portable, high level programming interface to
 various calling conventions. This allows a programmer to call any function
 specified by a call interface description at run-time.
 
 FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. A foreign function interface is the
 popular name for the interface that allows code written in one language to call
 code written in another language. The libffi library really only provides the
 lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.
 A layer must exist above libffi that handles type conversions for values passed
 between the two languages.

 application of this program is to use iptables in a default-drop stance to
 protect services such as SSH with an additional layer of security in order to
 make the exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code) much
 more difficult.

Description:  gpsd is a userland daemon acting as a translator between GPS and AIS receivers
 and their clients. gpsd listens on port 2947 for clients requesting
 position/time/velocity information.  The receivers are expected to generate
 position information in a well-known format -- as NMEA-0183 sentences, SiRF
 binary, Rockwell binary, Garmin binary format, or other vendor binary
 protocols.  gpsd takes this information from the GPS and translates it into
 something uniform and easier to understand for clients.

Description:  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
 level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
 paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
 functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
 syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
 to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
 usable as an extension language for applications that need a
 programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
 Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.
 
 This package contains only core Python library.

Description:  RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
 display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
 not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
 to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
 scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
 put friendly user interface on it.
 
 This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into
 librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with
 separate dynamic linked libraries.
 This package contains a shared library, used by other programs.

Description:  NaCl (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software library for network communication, encryption, decryption, signatures, etc.
 NaCl's goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.
 Sodium is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of NaCl (based on the latest released upstream version nacl-20110221), with a compatible API.
 The design choices, particularly in regard to the Curve25519 Diffie-Hellman function, emphasize security (whereas NIST curves emphasize "performance" at the cost of security), and "magic constants" in NaCl/Sodium have clear rationales.
 The same cannot be said of NIST curves, where the specific origins of certain constants are not described by the standards.
 And despite the emphasis on higher security, primitives are faster across-the-board than most implementations of the NIST standards.

Description:  libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.

Description:  Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that
 allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and
 power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware
 through the server, and are notified whenever the power status
 changes.
 upsd is responsible for serving the data from the drivers to the
 clients. It connects to each driver and maintains a local cache of the
 current state. Queries from the clients are served from this cache, so
 delays are minimal. This program is essential, and must be running at
 all times to actually make any use out of the drivers and clients.

 upscmd allows you to invoke "instant commands" in your UPS hardware. Not
 all hardware supports this, so check the list with -l to see if anything
 will work on your equipment. On hardware that supports it, you can use
 this program to start and stop battery tests, invoke a front panel test
 (beep!), turn the load on or off, and more.

 part of UPS monitoring--shutting down the system when the power goes
 out. It can call out to other helper programs for notification purposes
 during power events. upsmon can monitor multiple systems using a single
 process. Every UPS that is defined in the upsmon.conf configuration file
 is assigned a power value and a type (slave or master).

 UPS. It sends commands via the upsd to your driver, which configures the
 hardware for you. The list of variables that allow you to change their
 values is based on the capabilities of your UPS equipment. Not all
 models support this feature. Typically, cheaper hardware does not
 support any of them.

 port. It is primarily intended for diskless Linux hosts
 running as printer drivers but there is no reason why it
 could not be used on diskful hosts. Port 9100 is copied
 to /dev/lp0, 9101 to /dev/lp1 and 9102 to /dev/lp2. The
 default is port 9100 to /dev/lp0.

Description:  procps is a set of command line and full-screen utilities that provide information out of the pseudo-filesystem
 most commonly located at /proc. This filesystem provides a simple interface to the kernel data structures.
 The programs of procps generally concentrate on the structures that describe the processess running on the system.
 
 NOTE: some utilities provided by procps-ng packages (ps, uptime, kill, ...) are installed as busybox applets, by default.
 Conflicting applets should be removed from the build to avoid file conflicts.

Description:  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
 level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
 paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
 functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
 syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
 to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
 usable as an extension language for applications that need a
 programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
 Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.
 
 This package contains the asyncio module.

Description:  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
 level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
 paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
 functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
 syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
 to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
 usable as an extension language for applications that need a
 programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
 Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.

Description:  This project (pronounced gen'-see-oh) is used to abstract stream I/O
 like serial port, TCP, telnet, UDP, SSL, IPMI SOL etc and offers a
 framework for giving a consistent view of various stream (and packet)
 I/O types. You create a gensio object (or a gensio), and you can use
 that gensio without having to know too much about what is going on
 underneath. You can stack gensio on top of another one to add protocol
 funcionality. For instance, you can create a TCP gensio, stack SSL on
 top of that, and stack Telnet on top of that. It supports a number of
 network I/O and serial ports.  Gensio can be used for sending and
 receiving ports, and it also supports establishing encrypted and
 authenticated connections.
 .
 This package contains the Python3-bindings for libgensio.

Description:  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
 level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
 paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
 functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
 syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
 to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
 usable as an extension language for applications that need a
 programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
 Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.

Description:  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
 level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
 paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
 functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
 syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
 to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
 usable as an extension language for applications that need a
 programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
 Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.
 
 This package contains the XML modules.

Description:  RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
 display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
 not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
 to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
 scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
 put friendly user interface on it.
 
 This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into
 librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with
 separate dynamic linked libraries.
 This package contains the rrdcgi tool used to create web pages containing

Description:  rsync is a program that allows files to be copied to and from remote machines
 in much the same way as rcp. It has many more options than rcp, and uses the
 rsync remote-update protocol to greatly speed up file transfers when the
 destination file already exists.
 
 The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the differences
 between two sets of files across the network link.

 home and do not want to rent multiple decoders from their
 provider but just use their own streaming client (for example
 popcornhour/mediatomb/vlc).

Description:  libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.
 This package contains the video4linux utilities.

Description:  Yggdrasil builds end-to-end encrypted networks with IPv6.
 Beyond the similarities with cjdns is a different routing
 algorithm. This globally-agreed spanning tree uses greedy
 routing in a metric space. Back-pressure routing techniques
 allow advanced link aggregation bonding on per-stream basis.
 In turn, a single stream will span across multiple network
 interfaces simultaneously with much greater throughput.
