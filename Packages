Description:  external protocol is a general protocol for assisting
 setup of many virtual devices that lack proper
 protocol support in openwrt. Such as netavark, cni and
 netbird for example. External protocol is supposed
 to be managed with external software, not directly.
 
 external protocol works automaticly on the background
 and sets up netifd details when interface comes up or
 goes down. This allows one to easily add interface to
 a firewall zone.
 
 as a example use case, podman, with network where it's
 internal firewall and portmapper are disabled, control
 of firewalling, whether it was exposing ports or
 limiting/accepting access between networks, such as
 lan can be made through openwrt's own firewalling
 configuration if you used external protocol.
 
 podman example configuration could be as following:
 - lan network: 10.0.0.0/16 (255.255.0.0)
 - container network: 10.129.0.1/24 (255.255.255.0)
 
 Add a network configuration for your container network
 using external protocol. Then create firewall zone for it.
 
 You could create a new container/pod with static ip
 address 10.129.0.2 (as 10.129.0.1 as container network's
 gateway).
 
 Easily define permissions so that local networks can
 connect to container network, but not the other way around.
 Also you want to allow forwarding from/to wan.
 
 Now, as container cannot access local dns, make a rule for
 your firewall to accept connections from container network
 to port 53 (dns).
 
 Now all you have to do, is make redirects to your firewall
 and point them to 10.129.0.2 and connections from wan are
 redirectered to containers/pods.
 
 external protocol also works for other applications as
 well that are using veth/tun/etc devices and don't have
 a hand-tailored protocol available, such as vpn service
 netbird.
 
 Protocol has 3 settings: device, searchdomain and delay.
 Sometimes polling interfaces takes some time, and in
 that case you might want to add few seconds to delay.
 Otherwise, it can be excluded from configuration.
 Option for searchdomain is also completely optional.
 
 package was previously known as cni protocol but as
 it can be used on so many other things, naming became
 mis-leading and it was renamed to external protocol.

Description:  The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive.
 
 Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of
 multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables
 flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to
 machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power
 of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language
 that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
 
 This package provides the Go programming language source files needed
 for cross-compilation.

Description:  The libffi library provides a portable, high level programming interface to
 various calling conventions. This allows a programmer to call any function
 specified by a call interface description at run-time.
 
 FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. A foreign function interface is the
 popular name for the interface that allows code written in one language to call
 code written in another language. The libffi library really only provides the
 lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.
 A layer must exist above libffi that handles type conversions for values passed
 between the two languages.

 It does not make any syscalls nor allocations, it does not buffer data,
 it can be interrupted at anytime. Depending on your architecture,
 it only requires about 40 bytes of data per message stream
 (in a web server that is per connection).

Description:  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
 level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
 paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
 functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
 syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
 to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
 usable as an extension language for applications that need a
 programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
 Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.
 
 This package contains only core Python library.

Description:  RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
 display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
 not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
 to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
 scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
 put friendly user interface on it.
 
 This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into
 librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with
 separate dynamic linked libraries.
 This package contains a shared library, used by other programs.

Description:  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
 level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
 paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
 functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
 syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
 to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
 usable as an extension language for applications that need a
 programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many

Description:  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
 level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
 paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
 functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
 syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
 to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
 usable as an extension language for applications that need a
 programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
 Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.

Description:  RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
 display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
 not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
 to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
 scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
 put friendly user interface on it.
 
 This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into
 librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with
 separate dynamic linked libraries.
 This package contains the rrdcgi tool used to create web pages containing
 RRD graphs based on templates.

 home and do not want to rent multiple decoders from their
 provider but just use their own streaming client (for example
 popcornhour/mediatomb/vlc).
